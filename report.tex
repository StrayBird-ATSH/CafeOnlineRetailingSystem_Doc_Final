\section{Detailed description of refined function requirements}

\subsection{Scenario analysis and modeling}
We apply the use case diagram to the scenario analysis and modeling procedure. As the diagram shows, there are two actors including customers and shop assistants and the online  system in the whole interaction. Ordering and register are the  two main use cases. Several sub use cases of ordering like beverage information checking, beverage matching and beverage price calculating. And All these use cases include the smaller login user case.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.44]{figure1.jpg}
  \caption{Overall Use-case Diagram}\label{2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Use case 1: Ordering}
In this use-case, we apply the swim lane diagram to concisely describe the relationship between users and the system.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Use-case name:} ordering
\item \textbf{Actors:} customers and shop assistants
\item \textbf{Target:} The shop assistant can complete the order-making process according to the verbal instruction of customers.
\item \textbf{Precondition:} The shop assistant has registered before. 
\item \textbf{Triggering condition:} There is a customer waiting to order in the store.
\item \textbf{Main scene:} After the shop assistant logs in the system successfully, he/she waits for the verbal instructions of the customer. After the customer tells him/her the wanted cup-size, ingredients and kind of  beverages, the shop assistant can make an ordering, and tells the customer the total price, discounted price and discount information of the order. After the customer has paid the charge, the order is finished and the system will be waiting for another order.
\item \textbf{Abnormal scenes:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  \textbf{Login failure:} If the shop assistant enters wrong username or password, he can get the chance to enter again until he finally enters the correct username and password and logs in the system. 

\item \textbf{Order failure:} If the order process is interrupted due to the internet or other hardware break, the order process will return back to the calculating procedure after recovery.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Frequency:} The ordering use-case will be continuing 24 hours a day only if there is a customer waiting to order.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Use case 2: Register}
In the ordering user-case, we apply the activity diagram to describe the whole process. 
 \begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Use-case name:}  registering
\item \textbf{Actors:} shop assistants
\item \textbf{Target:} The shop assistant can complete the registering process.
\item \textbf{Precondition:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The server of the system is running normally.
\item The shop assistant has gained the access authorization before.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Triggering condition:} None
\item \textbf{Main scene:} After the shop assistant gains the access authorization successfully, he can enter the system to choose login or register. After he enters the valid username and password, he can use them to login and make orders.
\item \textbf{Abnormal scenes:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item  \textbf{Password invalid:} If the shop assistant enters invalid password, the system will prompt corresponding message and let the user enter again untill he enters the valid password.
\item \textbf{Username invalid:} If the shop assistant enters invalid username, the system will prompt corresponding message and let the user enter again until he enters the valid username.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Frequency:}  Relatively low, since only when there is new and unregistered shop assistant will it be triggered. However, the register use-case should be available 24 hours a day. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Class analysis and modeling}
\subsubsection{Analysis class extraction}
\begin{itemize}
\item User
\item AccountService
\item OrderItem
\item Order
\item PaymentInfo
\item OrderService
\item MarketingStrategy
\item DoubleElevenStrategy
\item FullDiscountStrategy
\item CombinationDiscountStrategy
\item LanguageService
\item MenuService
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Function of classes}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{User :} The entity class represents shop assistants. There are two attributes: name and password.
\item \textbf{AccountService :} The service class is charge of the login, signup, status-checking, name-checking and password-checking of users.
\item \textbf{OrderItem :} The entity class represents beverages. There are three attributes: name, size and ingredients. Also, it has a public method to calculate the price according to its size and ingredients.
\item \textbf{Order :} The DTO class is used to transfer data from server to client end. There are three attributes: id, currency and orderItems. Also, it has a public method to calculate the total charge of the order. 
\item \textbf{PaymentInfo :} The class is composed of all the return information of the order, including price, discount, discountPrice and messages.
\item \textbf{OrderService :} The service class includes one attribute strategies and one public method pay.
\item \textbf{MarketingStrategy :} The strategy class include one public method getDiscount. And all the  sub strategy classes including  DoubleElevenStrategy, FullDiscountStrategy and CombinationDiscountStrategy inherit it.
\item \textbf{LanguageService :} The service class has one public method updateLanguage.
\item \textbf{MenuService :} The service class has one public method getPrice according to different countries and regions.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Relationship between classes}
As the UML diagram shows, the relationships in this system can be divided into three kinds: inheritance, composition and dependency.

\chapter{Performance Demands}

\section{Massive end user support}
\subsection{Detailed Description}
There will be about 200 stores using this system at the same time. And the scale will be about 1000 people per day. The people using this system includes XXX.
\subsection{Proposed measures}
Since the system will be built on several servers, the strategies like load balancing can be used to handle the big amount of customers.

\section{Stability over long period of time}
\subsection{Detailed Description}
Since the store will be open 24 hours a day, the system must be running all the time and at least maintained evert half a year.
\subsection{Proposed measures}
This requires that the system should not stop or exit by accident at any time. We should handle all the possible accidents and catch the exceptions.

\item
Valuation: The salesperson can use the system to place orders when they have permission. After the order is placed, the price of different beverages can be calculated. The price of the beverage depends on the base price of the beverage, the price of the cup of the beverage, the price of the additional ingredients, and also consider the number of drinks. And a variety of preferential strategies.
\end{enumerate}
\par
General requirements: This system must support the salesperson to perform daily operations after obtaining the permission, including registration, registration, beverage matching, description acquisition and order placement. These daily operations must comply with the company's legal requirements. In addition, the system also needs to provide according to company regulations. Pricing function, these operations are convenient for the day-to-day operation of the salesperson.
\subsection{Development and operation personnel}
The development and operation personnel should have the following functions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Background maintenance: Maintenance personnel can configure and maintain various support such as drinks, ingredients, cups, offers, language, currency, pricing, etc. in the background according to company regulations;
\item
Log information: The maintenance personnel need the log information provided by the system during maintenance.
\item
Support the use of a large number of stores concurrently 
\item 
The system should be stable for a long time
\end{enumerate}
General requirements: Development and operation and maintenance personnel can perform system background maintenance according to company regulations, and provide standardized log information during system operation.
\subsection{Beverage shop customer}
The beverage shop customer should have the following functions:
\begin{enumerate}

\item
Description: You can see a description of the different beverages, a detailed description of the beverage price, and a specific description of the specifications used.
\end{enumerate}
\par
General requirements: The customer mainly performs system operation through the salesperson. The customer cares that the system can match the beverage that he wants, and at the same time needs to see the correct price and specific description. Of course, the customer wants the bigger the better.
\section{Module division of the project}
According to the demands of the project, the project can be divided into the following divisions:
the account services division, order controller division, the beverage repository implementation division and the utility tools division.
\par
The detailed description of the divisions will be discussed in the consequent chapters.
\section{User characteristics of the project}
There are three different users having relationship with this project.
\subsection{Beverage shop customers}
The beverage shop customers are the customers coming to the beverage shop and wish to buy beverage.
\subsection{Salesperson}
The salesperson are the workers in the beverage shop who help the customers place orders, charge the customers and provide beverages to the customers.
\subsection{Development and operation personnel}
The development and operation personnel are the developers of the system who are in charge of the future maintenance of the system. They will read the log info, organize databases and modify the application in response of the future demand changes.
\section{Run time environment}
There is no obvious runtime environment restriction of the application both in the back end and in the front end.
\par
After analysis of the market, the needs and demands, and the performance of the application, we have decided to use the following runtime environment as our production. 
\subsection{Server side runtime environment}
After thorough research about the server providers, we have decided to adopt the DELL Workstation as the server to proved service. As have stated above, there are about 1,000 customers coming to a store a day and there are 200 stores in total. However, what the distribution of customer flow over time is not given and according to the description from the teaching assistants, we can see the statistics above as the average customer flow to the store. In this way, every hour there might be 200,000 order requests, indicating that the server should handle at least 50 requests a second. We have found that the Dell OptiPlex 7050 with 3.6GHz Core i7-7700 CPU meet these demands well, whose 8 cores and 8MB cache will make request handling rapidly.
\par
The price for the DELL OptiPlex 7050 with the specification below will be about \$700  and it is well within our budgets.

\section{Detailed description of refined function requirements}

\subsection{Scenario analysis and modeling}
We apply the use case diagram to the scenario analysis and modeling procedure. As the diagram shows, there are two actors including customers and shop assistants and the online  system in the whole interaction. Ordering and register are the  two main use cases. Several sub use cases of ordering like beverage information checking, beverage matching, beverage price calculating, language and currency switch. And All these use cases include the smaller login user case.
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.43]{useCase.pdf}
  \caption{Overall Use-case Diagram}\label{1}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Use case 1: Ordering}
In this use-case, we apply the swim lane diagram to concisely describe the relationship between users and the system.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.33]{SwimLane.pdf}
  \caption{UML Swim Lane Diagram}\label{2}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Use-case name:} ordering
\item \textbf{Actors:} customers and shop assistants
\item \textbf{Target:} The shop assistant can complete the order-making process according to the verbal instruction of customers.
\item \textbf{Precondition:} The shop assistant has registered before. 
\item \textbf{Triggering condition:} There is a customer waiting to order in the store.
\item \textbf{Main scene:} After the shop assistant logs in the system successfully, he/she waits for the verbal instructions of the customer. After the customer tells him/her the wanted cup-size, ingredients and kind of  beverages, the shop assistant can make an ordering, and tells the customer the total price, discounted price and discount information of the order. After the customer has paid the charge, the order is finished and the system will be waiting for another order.
\item \textbf{Abnormal scenes:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  \textbf{Login failure:} If the shop assistant enters wrong username or password, he can get the chance to enter again until he finally enters the correct username and password and logs in the system. 

\item \textbf{Order failure:} If the order process is interrupted due to the internet or other hardware break, the order process will restart a new order.\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Frequency:} The ordering use-case will be continuing 24 hours a day only if there is a customer waiting to order.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Use case 2: Register}
In the ordering user-case, we apply the activity diagram to describe the whole process. 
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.44]{ActivityDiagram.pdf}
  \caption{Overall Use-case Diagram}\label{3}
\end{figure}

 \begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Use-case name:}  register
\item \textbf{Actors:} shop assistants
\item \textbf{Target:} The shop assistant can complete the register process.
\item \textbf{Precondition:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The server of the system is running normally.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Triggering condition:} None
\item \textbf{Main scene:} After the shop assistant gains the access authorization successfully, he can enter the system to choose login or register. After he enters the valid username and password, he can use them to login and make orders.
\item \textbf{Abnormal scenes:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item  \textbf{Password invalid:} If the shop assistant enters invalid password, the system will prompt corresponding message and let the user enter again untill he enters the valid password.
\item \textbf{Username invalid:} If the shop assistant enters invalid username, the system will prompt corresponding message and let the user enter again until he enters the valid username.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Frequency:}  Relatively low, since only when there is new and unregistered shop assistant will it be triggered. However, the register use-case should be available 24 hours a day. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Class analysis and modeling}
\subsubsection{Analysis class extraction}
\begin{itemize}
\item User
\item AccountService
\item OrderItem
\item Order
\item PaymentInfo
\item OrderService
\item MarketingStrategy
\item DoubleElevenStrategy
\item FullDiscountStrategy
\item CombinationDiscountStrategy
\item LanguageService
\item MenuService
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Function of classes}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{User :} The entity class represents shop assistants. There are two attributes: name and password.
\item \textbf{AccountService :} The service class is charge of the login, signup, status-checking, name-checking and password-checking of users.
\item \textbf{OrderItem :} The entity class represents beverages. There are three attributes: name, size and ingredients. Also, it has a public method to calculate the price according to its size and ingredients.
\item \textbf{Order :} The DTO class is used to transfer data from server to client end. There are three attributes: id, currency and orderItems. Also, it has a public method to calculate the total charge of the order. 
\item \textbf{PaymentInfo :} The class is composed of all the return information of the order, including price, discount, discountPrice and messages.
\item \textbf{OrderService :} The service class includes one attribute strategies and one public method pay.
\item \textbf{MarketingStrategy :} The strategy class include one public method getDiscount. And all the  sub strategy classes including  DoubleElevenStrategy, FullDiscountStrategy and CombinationDiscountStrategy inherit it.
\item \textbf{LanguageService :} The service class has one public method updateLanguage.
\item \textbf{MenuService :} The service class has one public method getPrice according to different countries and regions.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Relationship between classes}
As the UML diagram shows, the relationships in this system can be divided into three kinds: inheritance, composition and dependency.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.38]{UMLClass.pdf}
  \caption{Overall UML Class Diagram}\label{4}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Data Flow analysis and modeling}
We apply the DFD(data flow diagram) to describe the flow of the input data and output data.
We 
\subsubsection{level 0:} The top/level-0 diagram is an overall description of the whole system. The external entity are only control panel and control panel display. The data flow diagram for level 0 is shown as Figure \ref{5}.

\chapter{Performance Demands}

\section{Massive end user support}
\subsection{Detailed Description}
There will be about 200 stores using this system at the same time. And the sale scale will be about 1000 people per day. The people using this system includes customers and shop assistants.
\subsection{Proposed measures}
Since the system will be built on several servers, the strategies like load balancing can be used to handle the big amount of customers.

\section{Stability over long period of time}
\subsection{Detailed Description}
Since the store will be open 24 hours a day, the system must be running all the time and at least maintained evert half a year. Also, the response time of every order  should be less than 2 seconds.
\subsection{Proposed measures}
This requires that the system should not stop or exit by accident at any time. We should handle all the possible accidents and catch the exceptions. And we should try every means to enhance the speed of the system.

The 1000 customers is a approximate number. It is a non-functional restriction and this might influence another function - the order number, which should be unique considering the order number stated below.
\item Is there a regulation or limitation on the system running server-side operating system? 
\par
The infrastructure of the system has no restriction and should be purchased. We should consider the budget while considering the hardware specifications.
\item What are the rules or restrictions for the client device operating system (in the store)?

\end{enumerate}
 \subsection{Performance requirements (5 minutes)}
 \begin{enumerate}
\item Is 1,000 person/day referring to the salesperson or the customer (personal * month) ? What is the upper limit? 
\par
The 1000 customers is a approximate number. It is a non-functional restriction and this might influence another function - the order number, which should be unique considering the order number stated below.
\par
The upper limit will not be too greater than the general expectation above.
\item What is the number of the stores in the description ``Support the usage of massive stores concurrently''?  What is the average number of orders in the store? And what about the peak order number? 
\par
The system should support the service with the customer number stated above. The average number is the customer number stated above and the peak number will not be too much greater than the average number.
\item Order response time? 
\par 
The response time is 2 seconds for each order. It means from the order successfully created in the front end to the result of the order from the back end sent to the front end.
\item ``Long-running and stable support system ": the requirements for a client front end and user-friendliness, cannot be unable to play due to any reason except network or hardware issues, cannot crash under massive clients, cannot have severe bug after online
\par
The system should run 24 hours a day and should not break down because of the program rather than physical problems. If an order is interrupted because of the network issues, the system can simply discard the order information.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Functional requirements(15 minutes)}
\begin{enumerate}

The first three offers and the last offers are superposition offers, while the full discount offer and the double eleven offer are different.
\item Language, currency, pricing 
\par
The price is different for each currency and we need to provide a price table for each of the currency we provide. In the meanwhile, we still need to provide a description for each item on the menu in each language we provide. That is to say, the menu should have versions according to the languages.
\par
These information are available after the order in the system. The order placing operation includes generating these information.
\par
In addition, the US Dollar is added into the system while the languages provided remain the same.
\item Register \& log in 
\par
The detailed specification for the register and log in function are the same as Lab 3, and the requirement documentation for Lab 3 can be referred.
\item Order versus Associate / independent with drinks, price, and description?

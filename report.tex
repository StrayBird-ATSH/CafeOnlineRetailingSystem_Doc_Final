\chapter{Demands of this lab}
\section{Requirements of this lab}
According to the documentation of the lab assigner, this lab should satisfy the requirments in the following perspectives:
\subsection{Documentation}
In the documentation, we need to accomplish two parts, that is, we need to:
Understand the needs of this experiment, complete the requirements document;
Organize overall design documentation and detailed design documentation based on requirements.
\subsection{Code Style}
Before the experiment, our group members should agree on the code specification and the unified code style.
\subsection{Project Management}
The project is generally hosted on the Huawei Devcloud platform, on which platform we are going to finish the following tasks:
Project management should be arranged based on the DevCloud platform, including adding work items, assigning work items, associating work items, managing work item status, and other project management functions;
\par
Issues in the development process need to be recorded and managed on DevCloud, including defect reports in integrated development;
\par
Collaborative development based on Git, submit project documentation and code on a team basis.

\section{Switch Language Implementation}
\par The switch of language will be mainly displayed in the user interface, so all the information that need to be multi-translated will be separately placed into  different constant files. In this iteration of implementation, we only instantiate the Chinese and English versions. And the correspondent service classes will use a typical mechanism called reflection to implement the switch of different constant language files.
\par In the following two sections, the detailed design of constant files and language service classes will be respectively clarified.
\subsection{Language Constant Files}
\par The two constant files are positioned in the constant package. In these two files, all the variables (there are no methods) are qualified with public static final String since they are all constant strings.
\par To our attention, all the necessary variables should have the same names in all the language files to maintain the availability of reflection.
\subsection{Language Service Classes }
\par To follow the idea of prototype development, all the concrete service classes should implement their corresponding interfaces. The interface make it clear what the service will implement and its parameters. The most notable design pattern in this class is single-instance pattern.

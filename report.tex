\section{Refined function requirements}
\subsection{Administration access Authorization}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Any shop assistant must first get authorized administration access of the system before he conducts all the normal routines including signing up, logging in, matching drinks, getting drink descriptions and ordering. 
\item Anyone except shop assistants is unauthorized to the administration access.
\item To get the authorized administration access, the shop assistant must do XXXXXX.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Signing up}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Any shop assistant can use the unique username and password to sign up.
\item The username will be persistently recorded in the user.csv (?) after the shop assistant signs up.
\item The username must start with \textbf{starbb\_};
\item The username can consist of \textbf{letters}, \textbf{numbers} and \textbf{underline}, excluding any other symbols;
\item The username should have a length greater than or equal to 8 and less than 50.
\item The password can consist of \textbf{letters}, \textbf{numbers} and \textbf{\_}, excluding any other symbols;
\item The password must consist of all the three types, i.e. \textbf{letters}, \textbf{numbers} and \textbf{\_}, excluding any other symbols;

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Logging in}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Only if the shop assistant logs in successfully can he do the other normal routines including matching drinks, getting drink descriptions and ordering.
\item The shop assistant will log in successfully if and only if the username and password are matched.
\item The login status will be recorded after the shop assistant logs in successfully.
\item If the shop assistant fails to log in, the system will throw a runtime exception to prompt the failed login.
\item If the shop assistant fails to log in because of wrong password, the system will prompt \textbf{Username or password error};
\item If the shop assistant fails to log in, he will not allowed to conduct any other operations.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Matching drinks}

\begin{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Order charge calculation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The shop assistant can order according to the verbal instructions of the customer.
\item The shop assistant can calculate the order charge including the original price, discount and the total discount charge.
\item The customer can check the order charge including the original price, discount and the total discount charge.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Drinks supported}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The default drinks include coffee and tea.
\item The default coffee includes Espresso and Cappuccino.
\item The default tea includes GreenTea and RedTea.

\item Combination strategy has four concrete strategies.
\item The concrete strategies can have superposition.
\item Different categories of discount strategies cannot have superposition.
\item Combination 1: Order including both tea and coffee will have 15\% discount.
\item Combination 2: 2 cups of Large-cup Espresso will have 20\% off discount.
\item Combination 3: Buying three cups of tea will send one for free.
\item Combination 4: Cappuccino second half price.
\item Full count: All drinks full 100 minus 30
\item Double Eleven: All drinks 50\% off.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Language switch}
